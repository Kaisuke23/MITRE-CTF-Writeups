***Difficulties:***

I did have someone reach out to me saying that they wanted to be a part of my team, but during the day of, they told me that they were a part of another team which left me floundering a bit and not knowing what direction to take. This made my life a little hard in which i am still not knowledgeable on how to find it. COMMUNICATION IS KEY. I felt like i was just abandoned... oh well, thats how my life has been. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

A person whom i have been talking security to has been telling me that it took him a few years to learn what he learned today. So i just have to take what i found here and learn from it
